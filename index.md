### Self-assessment
	I have immensely enjoyed my experience in the Computer Science program and have learned so much about all aspects of Computer Science. I currently work as a full-time software engineer and enjoy my employment very much; my knowledge and skills have grown greatly throughout my career in the Computer Science program. 
	I have learned to work in a team environment, which has already benefitted me greatly in my career, and learned that when writing a program or section of a program, it is important to assure a classmate or coworker coming into your code can easily follow and understand what exactly is happening. Communication to stakeholders has also been a great experience in this course as the job of a software engineer many times is to create something for a customer. The customer must be satisfied, and you must assure you are including every aspect the customer wants included, which can only be done with proper communication.
	Data structures and algorithms has been the area I have grown the most, as I am now able to write my code very structured and easy to follow while also assuring, I am following and utilizing the proper algorithms for each instance. In the case below, I rewrote this code multiple times to assure I was using the best algorithm for the system to process the code the fastest. 
	Working with databases is also something I practiced using the code above as I created a code to run through an already existing database specific to what the user is entering and requesting. This was a very vital part in my learning as this is what I am doing now in my current profession and I learned about the security of the data in the database and how important that is to maintain while also learning to work with and manipulate existing data. 
	I have chosen the two artifacts included because I feel they depict both my abilities to work with an existing database as well as add to an existing database of data. Both which are very important in my current career and many careers in the computer science field. Whether a program is being written with no existing data or a full database of data, it is crucial to know how to work with the data the comes in or is already set, while also assuring the data is secured.|

### Category 1: Software Engineering & Design
This updated [artifact](https://github.com/leticiah8231/leticiah8231.github.io/blob/622fa122bbd2c884b41a82a6e545a78733ad4b8b/Lab1-3.cpp) is a great example of engineering and design as the program works seamlessly with a database as well as input from the user. This specific code takes information from the user, such as dog breed, or city and  is meant to work with existing data from multiple animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs by their type of rescue. I've created this program to work any set of data, as the variable names are easy to manipulate and give the same results. Here are some examples of what the program willl run when user enters desired information:

### Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
This [Artifact](https://github.com/leticiah8231/leticiah8231.github.io/blob/1df206c13bcb3fa3e7a7af5143ca1ead4c68d3e5/animal_shelter(1)(1).py) is well-organized, processes quickly and correctly, and is well commented for other users coming into the program. This artifact was a bit tougher to create as throughout my time creating the artifact, I went re-worked the artifact multiple times to have it run smoother faster. This is also a reason I included this artifact as by using this artifact, I am able to showcase my ability to write a code that processes quickly and neatly. This artifact was created on 5/10/2020, during a course in my Undergraduate career. This artifact works with a database of data to pull the information requested by the user. While working on this artifact, as the previous, I learned to write and submit each code as if you are presenting it directly to a professor or manager. Assuring the entire code is neat and well commented is important for yourself and future users. I did face the challenge of accessing the number of artifacts needed along with the files needed to run the program, but once that was figured out, it ran very smoothly, and I enjoyed altering previous code. This process is much easier than writing the initial code and really makes a difference, this is definitely a step I will include from now on throughout my career as a Software Engineer.

### Category 3: Database Integration
I have chosen to include this [Artifact](https://github.com/leticiah8231/leticiah8231.github.io/blob/622fa122bbd2c884b41a82a6e545a78733ad4b8b/Lab1-3.cpp) in my portfolio because I feel it is well-organized, processes quickly and correctly, and is well commented for other users coming into the program. The structure of the program is written very well organized, and the algorithms are neatly written and easy to follow or manipulate for future users. This artifact was created on 6/27/2021, during a course in my Undergraduate career. The program is meant to work with existing data from multiple shelters to identify and categorize available dogs by their type of rescue. The program will use the organizations data to organize and pull the requested data according to what the user has entered.
