## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/leticiah8231/leticiah8231.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Self-assessment

```markdown

	I have immensely enjoyed my experience in the Computer Science program 
and have learned so much about all aspects of Computer Science. I currently work 
as a full-time software engineer and enjoy my employment very much; my knowledge 
and skills have grown greatly throughout my career in the Computer Science 
program. 
	I have learned to work in a team environment, which has already 
benefitted me greatly in my career, and learned that when writing a 
program or section of a program, it is important to assure a 
classmate or coworker coming into your code can easily follow 
and understand what exactly is happening. Communication to 
stakeholders has also been a great experience in this course 
as the job of a software engineer many times is to create something 
for a customer. The customer must be satisfied, and you must assure you 
are including every aspect the customer wants included, which can 
only be done with proper communication.
	Data structures and algorithms has been the area I have grown 
the most, as I am now able to write my code very structured and easy 
to follow while also assuring, I am following and utilizing the proper 
algorithms for each instance. In the case below, I rewrote this code 
multiple times to assure I was using the best algorithm for the system 
to process the code the fastest. 
	Working with databases is also something I practiced using the 
code above as I created a code to run through an already existing 
database specific to what the user is entering and requesting. This 
was a very vital part in my learning as this is what I am doing now in 
my current profession and I learned about the security of the data in the 
database and how important that is to maintain while also learning to work 
with and manipulate existing data. 
	I have chosen the two artifacts included because I feel they depict 
both my abilities to work with an existing database as well as add to an 
existing database of data. Both which are very important in my current 
career and many careers in the computer science field. Whether a program 
is being written with no existing data or a full database of data, it is 
crucial to know how to work with the data the comes in or is already set, 
while also assuring the data is secured.
